**meeting-notes** contain the summary of meetings labeled in DD-MM-YYYY.<br>
**my-app** contains the actual application written in React. 

# Application
To start development make sure you have these installed: <br>
- Node 16.14.2 or higher
- npm 8.7 or higher
- React (installed via "npm install react")

To launch the React app locally, go to "my-app" and type "npm start". This will then launch the application on local host 3000. <br>

The **components** folder holds the components for the React app. Follow the "template.js" to create your own component. <br>
The **css** folder holds the styling of the components. For good practice, name your .css file the same name as your *component*.js. <br>
